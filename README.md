# out -- a repository to hold FDS output results

This repository stores fairly large and numerous output files from FDS validation simulations. Because these simulations are re-run with each new release of FDS, this repository can get quite large, but we do not need to maintain its history. Thus, every once in a while we can erase its history without impacting the rest of the FDS project files.
